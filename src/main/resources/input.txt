This ASCII value represents the character variable
in numbers, and each character variable is assigned with
some number range from 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII value
 of 'C' is 67. Here in the above example, if we assign 'C'
to the character variable, 67 is stored in the variable rather than 'A' itself.
